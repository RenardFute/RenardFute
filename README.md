## 👀 About Me

### 🎓 At school

I'm a student a the University of Nantes in France. Currently in my first year in a Mathematics and Informatics Bachelor Degree. Until now, my classes are just about algebra and small algorithms. However, being in a special section targeting a Master's Degree, we have projects to engineer each year. 

#### 🔧🔬 Project of the year

Each year our "managers" give us a list of a few subjects for our engineering projects. Then we have to make small groups of students (~4 students on average). And return a prototype before the end of the semester.

This time our group, choose to make a game board. At first, we have been asked to make a single game on a homemade gameboard. So we had to build the screen and the controllers by ourselves. 
But after some thinking and brainstorming, we thought that it would be way more interesting to build, not only the gameboard and the controller but also a library to build games for it.

### 👨‍💻 At home

When I'm coming back to my place, I love learning new technologies and giving myself challenges. My main language is Java, mainly because I love OOP but also because it's the one I'm the most used to. I'm programming since my twelves when I was only doing Minecraft-oriented programming.  I quickly get into learning new programming languages which brought me to C#, JavaScript, PHP. 

I'm pretty proud of those projects:

[![AppBuilder](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/pin?username=pulsedev2&repo=AppBuilder)](https://github.com/pulsedev2/AppBuilder)
